\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}} \\*This class is the base class for different types of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}} in the game }{\pageref{class_a_i}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_controller}{Controller}} \\*This class is the controller of the application. It integrates model and the view of the application. It also takes input from the user and passes information to the model }{\pageref{class_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_gameplay_g_u_i}{Gameplay\+G\+UI}} \\*This is the view part of the application. It gets game information from the model and displays it on the screen }{\pageref{class_gameplay_g_u_i}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_greedy_a_i}{Greedy\+AI}} \\*This is a derived class of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}}. This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}} selects the best possible move out of all possible moves }{\pageref{class_greedy_a_i}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_no_a_i}{No\+AI}} \\*This is a derived class of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}}. It is a \char`\"{}\+Null Object\char`\"{} class which does nothing. It allows Player vs Player mode by not making any move }{\pageref{class_no_a_i}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer}} \\*This is an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer}} base class. The View is derived from it. It observes from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject}} class for any information }{\pageref{class_observer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_othello_board}{Othello\+Board}} \\*This class is the model of the application. It has all the game logic inside it. It is a derived class of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject}}, and it is observed by View of the application }{\pageref{class_othello_board}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_othello_game}{Othello\+Game}} }{\pageref{class_othello_game}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_othello_player}{Othello\+Player}} }{\pageref{class_othello_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_random_a_i}{Random\+AI}} \\*This is a derived class of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_i}{AI}} }{\pageref{class_random_a_i}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject}} \\*This is the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject}} base class. The model is derived from it. It is observed by the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer}} class }{\pageref{class_subject}}{}
